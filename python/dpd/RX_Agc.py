    """The goal of the automatic gain control is to set the
    RX gain to a value at which all received amplitudes can
    be detected. This means that the maximum possible amplitude
    should be quantized at the highest possible digital value.

    A problem we have to face, is that the estimation of the
    maximum amplitude by applying the max() function is very
    unstable. This is due to the maximumâ€™s rareness. Therefore
    we estimate a far more robust value, such as the median,
    and then approximate the maximum amplitude from it.

    Given this, we tune the RX gain in such a way, that the
    received signal fulfills our desired property, of having
    all amplitudes properly quantized."""
